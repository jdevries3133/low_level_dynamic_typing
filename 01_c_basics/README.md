# C Language Basics

This is a basic overview of the C programming language, and an opportunity to
see the format that all of our examples will take. Hopefully, this is a good
enough overview of C that a programmer who is only familiar with high-level
dynamic languages will be able to proceed without any further review.

## Makefile

By just running `make` in a terminal inside this directory, you will compile the
code, and produce a `example` binary in the same folder as this readme. The
program can then be executed as `./example`.

Note that you will need the GNU C Compiler (`gcc`) setup on your system. On
macOS, this is included when you setup developer tools with `sudo xcode-select
--install`. On Debian systems, you may need to `sudo apt-get install -y
build-essential`. For other Linux systems, look up how to install a C compiler
using your system's package manager. For Windows users, it'll be easiest to try
out these examples by using WSL.

## What to Do

Review the code inside `src`. Use the `Makefile` to compile and run the code.
Feel free to play around and revise the code to test your understanding. You can
start reading in `./src/main.h`.
